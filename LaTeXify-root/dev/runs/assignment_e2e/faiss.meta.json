In mathematics, communication is important to ensure that those who are reading our work can understand what the problems are, which methods we are going to use to solve the problems, and why we choose to use certain methods. In order to communicate effectively, we must ensure that we clearly define which variables we intend to use and use the appropriate vocabulary, terminology, and notations in the calculations. Showing all of our steps also helps to communicate with the readers. Wrap up each of the solutions with a concluding statement; a proper concluding statement clearly defines the results of the solution in a concise statement. Keep all of these factors in mind when working through this assignment and all future assignments in the course.",
