Congratulations! You've reached the first assignment in your course. To submit your assignment, navigate to the next page, upload your file(s), and select the "Submit" button to submit the assignment to your teacher. Before completing an assignment, complete all of the practice activities in the unit, and wait for feedback. The feedback from the practice activities will help you improve your understanding and will help you achieve the best possible mark on your assignments.

You may choose to complete your mathematical calculations by hand and scan them or take images to upload to the dropbox. To help your teacher review your work, submit your calculations as a single file document (preferably as a pdf). If you aren't sure how to do this, email your teacher for assistance.
