a)
An airplane must travel400km. Let t be the travel time (in hours) and lets(t) denote the speed
(in km/h).
Speed = Distance
Time
s(t) =400

(t >0, km/h)
b)
An ice cream cone starts at125 mL and loses half its volume every5 min. Let t be in minutes and
v(t) be the volume (mL); the discrete half-life model is
v(t) =v0
