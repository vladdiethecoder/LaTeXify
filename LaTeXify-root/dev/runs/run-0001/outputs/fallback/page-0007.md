Question 5 (8 points)
The point(1, −2) is on the graph off. Describe the following transformations onf, and determine
the resulting point.
We use
g(x) =a f
(
k(x −d)
)
+ c,
x′= x
k + d,
y′= a y+ c.
a) g(x) = 2f(x) + 3
The a = 2indicates a vertical stretch by a factor of2 and thec = 3indicates a vertical translation
of 3 units up.
x′= x
k + d
= 1
1 + 0
= 1
y′= a y+ c
= 2(−2) + 3
= −1
Therefore, the resulting point is(1, −1) .
