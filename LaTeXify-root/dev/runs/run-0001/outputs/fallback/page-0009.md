d) g(x) =−f(−x −1) + 3
The a = −1 indicates a reflection in thex-axis, thek = −1 indicates a reflection in they-axis, the
d = −1 (from x −d = x −(−1) =x + 1) indicates a horizontal translation of1 unit to the left, and
the c = 3indicates a vertical translation of3 units up.
x′= x
k + d
= 1
−1 + (−1)
= −2
y′= a y+ c
= (−1)(−2) + 3
= 5
Therefore, the resulting point is(−2, 5) .
