Question 3 (6 points)
Using graphs, decide whether each inverse is a function. Figures are side by side (uniform size) with
concise captions. Below each pair, the reasoning lines up the “⇒” arrows and the verdict is boxed.
a) p−1
i Inverse (reflection acrossy = x).
 ii Vertical line test: fails.
Construct inverse: reflect graph ofy = p(x) across y = x ⇒ graph ofp−1
Apply VLT top−1 : some verticals cut the graph twice ⇒ Inverse isnot a function
Domain/Range swap: Dom(p−1) =Ran(p), Ran(p−1) =Dom(p)
b) f−1
i Inverse of a line (reflection acrossy = x).
 ii Vertical line test: passes.
Construct inverse: reflect non-vertical line acrossy = x ⇒ another non-vertical line
Apply VLT tof−1 : each vertical meets at most once ⇒ Inverse is a function
Domain/Range swap: Dom(f−1) =Ran(f), Ran(f−1) =Dom(f)
