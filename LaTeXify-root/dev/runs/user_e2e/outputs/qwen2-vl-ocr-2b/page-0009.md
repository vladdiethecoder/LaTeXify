The given information is:

- \( a = -1 \) indicates a reflection in the \( x \)-axis.
- \( k = -1 \) indicates a reflection in the \( y \)-axis.
- \( d = -1 \) (from \( x - d = x - (-1) = x + 1 \)) indicates a horizontal translation of 1 unit to the left.
- \( c = 3 \) indicates a vertical translation of 3 units up.

The transformation equations are:
- \( x' = \frac{x}{k} + d \)
- \( y' = a y + c \)

Let's calculate the transformed coordinates:

1. \( x' = \frac{x}{-1} + (-1) \)
2. \( y' = -1 \cdot (-2) + 3 \)
3. \( y' = 5 \)

Therefore, the resulting point is \( \boxed{(-2, 5)} \).
