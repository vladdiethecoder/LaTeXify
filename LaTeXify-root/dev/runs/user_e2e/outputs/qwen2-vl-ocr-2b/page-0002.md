Question 1 (6 points)

Rewrite each relationship using function notation. All given text retained; one “=” per line; equals aligned.

a)

An airplane must travel 400 km. Let \( t \) be the travel time (in hours) and let \( s(t) \) denote the speed (in km/h).

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Speed} &= \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \\
s(t) &= \frac{400}{t}
\end{align*}
\]

b)

An ice cream cone starts at 125 mL and loses half its volume every 5 min. Let \( t \) be in minutes and \( v(t) \) be the volume (mL); the discrete half-life model is

\[
\begin{align*}
v(t) &= v_0 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/T_{1/2}} \\
v(t) &= 125 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/5}
\end{align*}
\]

c)

Scott drives at a constant speed of 50 km/h. If \( d(t) \) is the distance (km) after \( t \) hours,

\[
d(t) = 50t
\]

Question 2 (6 points)

Formatting: parts (a) and (b) are side by side with a clean divider; all “=” signs aligned inside each block.
