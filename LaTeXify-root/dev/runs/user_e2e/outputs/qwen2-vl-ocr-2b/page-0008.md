The given text is a mathematical problem involving transformations of functions. Here is the logical reading order of the text:

1. **b) \( g(x) = f(x + 1) - 3 \)**:
   - The function \( g(x) \) is defined as the result of applying the transformation \( f(x + 1) \) to \( x \) and then subtracting 3 from the result.

2. **The transformation \( f(x + 1) \) indicates a horizontal translation of 1 unit to the left**.
   - This means that the input \( x \) is shifted to the left by 1 unit.

3. **The transformation \( -3 \) indicates a vertical translation of 3 units down**.
   - This means that the output \( g(x) \) is shifted down by 3 units.

4. **Therefore, the resulting point is \( \boxed{(0, -5)} \)**:
   - This is the final transformed point after applying the given transformations to the original function \( f(x) \).

5. **c) \( g(x) = -f(2x) \)**:
   - The function \( g(x) \) is defined as the result of applying the transformation \( -f(2x) \) to \( x \).

6. **The transformation \( -f(2x) \) indicates a reflection in the \( x \)-axis**.
   - This means that the input \( x \) is reflected across the \( x \)-axis.

7. **The transformation \( k = 2 \) indicates a horizontal compression by a factor of 1/2**.
   - This means that the input \( x \) is compressed horizontally by a factor of 1/2.

8. **Therefore, the resulting point is \( \boxed{\left(\frac{1}{2}, 2\right)} \)**:
   - This is the final transformed point after applying the given transformations to the original function \( f(x) \).

The text provides a step-by-step explanation of how to transform a given function using horizontal and vertical translations, reflections, and compressions.
