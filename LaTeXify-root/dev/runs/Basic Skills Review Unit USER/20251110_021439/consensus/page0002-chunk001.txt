Question 1 (6 points) Rewrite each relationship using function notation.All
given text retained; one “=” per line; equals aligned. a) An airplane must
travel400km. Let t be the travel time (in hours) and lets(t) denote the speed
(in km/h). Speed = Distance Time s(t) =400 t (t >0, km/h) b) An ice cream cone
starts at125 mL and loses half its volume every5 min. Let t be in minutes and
v(t) be the volume (mL); the discrete half-life model is v(t) =v0 ( 1 2 )t/T1/2
