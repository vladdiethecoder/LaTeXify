1. Record a short video (approximately 2 minutes) of yourself solving the problem and narrate the reasoning behind each step. Imagine that you are a teacher, teaching a class that has not learned the topic yet.

2. Record a short audio file (approximately 2 minutes) of yourself teaching or explaining the problem and its solution. Think of it like a radio show where viewers may or may not have mathematical background. How can you help all of the viewers to understand?

3. Create a slideshow (approximately 10 slides) using a program such as Prezi or Powerpoint to create a dynamic presentation of your question and its solution. In a presentation you can include animations, pictures, audio/video, etc. to help reach your audience.
