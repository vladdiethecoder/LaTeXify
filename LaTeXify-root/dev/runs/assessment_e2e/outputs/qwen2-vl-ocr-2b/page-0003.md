(79,107),(857,189)

For each of the functions below, state the domain and range, the restrictions, the intervals of increasing and decreasing, the roots, y-intercepts, and vertices.

a) \( f(x) = 2x^2 - 8 \)

b) \( f(x) = +\sqrt{x - 2} \)

c) \( f(x) = \frac{x + 1}{x - 1} \)

Question 5 (8 points)

The point (1, -2) is on the graph of \( f(x) \). Describe the following transformations on \( f(x) \), and determine the resulting point.

a) \( g(x) = 2f(x) + 3 \)

b) \( g(x) = f(x + 1) - 3 \)

c) \( g(x) = -f(2x) \)

d) \( g(x) = -f(-x - 1) + 3 \)
