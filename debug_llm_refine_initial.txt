\section*{Transformations on Function $f$}

The point $(1, -2)$ is on the graph of $f$. Describe the following transformations on $f$, and determine the resulting point.

We use
\[ g(x) = a f \left( \frac{x - d}{k} \right) + c, \]
\[ x' = \frac{x}{k} + d, \]
\[ y' = a y + c. \]

\subsection*{Part (a)}
\[ g(x) = 2f(x) + 3 \]

The $a = 2$ indicates a vertical stretch by a factor of 2 and the $c = 3$ indicates a vertical translation of 3 units up.
\[ x' = \frac{x}{k} + d = \frac{1}{1} + 0 = 1 \]
\[ y' = a y + c = 2(-2) + 3 = -1 \]

Therefore, the resulting point is $(1, -1)$.

\subsection*{Part (b)}
\[ g(x) = f(x + 1) - 3 \]

The $d = -1$ (since $x - d = x - (-1) = x + 1$) indicates a horizontal translation of 1 unit to the left and the $c = -3$ indicates a vertical translation of 3 units down.
\[ x' = \frac{x}{k} + d = \frac{1}{1} + (-1) = 0 \]
\[ y' = a y + c = 1(-2) + (-3) = -5 \]

Therefore, the resulting point is $(0, -5)$.

\subsection*{Part (c)}
\[ g(x) = -f(2x) \]

The $a = -1$ indicates a reflection in the x-axis and the $k = 2$ indicates a horizontal compression by a factor of $\frac{1}{2}$.
\[ x' = \frac{x}{k} + d = \frac{1}{2} + 0 = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ y' = a y + c = (-1)(-2) + 0 = 2 \]

Therefore, the resulting point is $\left( \frac{1}{2}, 2 \right)$.

\subsection*{Part (d)}
\[ g(x) = -f(-x - 1) + 3 \]

The $a = -1$ indicates a reflection in the x-axis, the $k = -1$ indicates a reflection in the y-axis, the $d = -1$ (from $x - d = x - (-1) = x + 1$) indicates a horizontal translation of 1 unit to the left, and the $c = 3$ indicates a vertical translation of 3 units up.
\[ x' = \frac{x}{k} + d = \frac{1}{-1} + (-1) = -2 \]
\[ y' = a y + c = (-1)(-2) + 3 = 5 \]

Therefore, the resulting point is $(-2, 5)$.
